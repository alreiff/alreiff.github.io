#== Study of social networks through stochastic processes and game theory
#In DSL networks, DSL amplifiers and multiplexers limit the maximum rate for individual modems using a set of parameters defined as profiles. To optimize the network performance, profiles need to be adapted to the individual line conditions. Large scale optimizations over a highly heterogeneous DSL network can be sensitive to behavior of the individual components of the network. The two major challenges are configuring profile optimization to enhance network performance, and network monitoring to avoid any adverse effect of a centralized optimization. %Machine learning algorithms can be utilized to monitor the network performance.
#A direct way of improving communication performance over DSL lines is to detect and cancel non-stationary impulse noise. It is very difficult to design a unique filter for every impulse type. Therefore, one can classify impulses into categories and trigger the filter on detection of an associated impulse category.

== Nudges for Inducing Prosocial Behavior

=== Information Design

In this work, we investigate, by designing the reputation benefit, how much it is possible to increase the prosocial behavior of a set of agents. Our framework is based on a mean-field Bayesian game.

=== Opinion shaping

The goal is to get agents to adopt more pro-social behaviour by targeting them through social advertising. However the topology of the social network is unknown, but we have partial observations while monitoring some agents. We have proposed “reinforcement learning” algorithms for the dissemination/adoption of practices or opinions in a network where topology is unknown.

== Study of social networks through stochastic processes and game theory
In this line of research, we applied the game theory and stochastic processes to model the competition over popularity and visibility in social networks.

=== Algorithmic contributions

The topic here is to use telecommunication modeling tools to model and shape the timeline in social networks. Typical results are the design of Qoe-enhancing algorithms and the evidence of convergence of these algorithms towards the optimal solution.

=== Game theory contributions

The topic here is the study of competition over popularity using game theoretical tools. We are able to study the properties of Nash’s equilibria, of the price of anarchy and to obtain a better understanding of the possible problems induced by a competition for popularity.

=== Data extraction/analysis contributions

We have studied how to estimate the popularity and visibility in social networks. We also studied the bias in the filtering algorithm.

#=== Quantization for Positive Random Variables with Infinite Support

#Efficient quantization schemes exist for random variables with bounded support. We explore quantization at a more fundamental level, focusing on positive random variables of unbounded support. We exploit established properties of Banach spaces, together with the boundedness of probability measures, to provide bounds on the number of bits necessary to achieve a desired level of performance.

#=== Subcarrier Allocation for OFDMA

#In multi-user OFDMA systems, users see diverse realizations of the multiple subcarriers. For elastic traffic, a new subcarrier allocation algorithm was proposed, that exploits this diversity gain when buffer and channel state information are available at the transmitter. The proposed algorithm was shown to improve throughput performance when compared to existing algorithms.
